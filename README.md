# Portfolio - Underconstruction

Website for my personal work.

**Link to project:** myraha.io

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a four page, responsive website that features my work from development, design and fine arts projects. Each page has a list of languages, frameworks and tools I use with images and links to each respective project. One cool feature I added was the pop out navigation, made with a few simple JavaScript event listeners.

## Lessons Learned:
As this is an ongoing project I am fortunate enough to be learning something new every time progress (or not!) is made! So far, Iâ€™ve doven deeper into the complexities of responsiveness and have learned a few tricks with margins, and css for keeping code integrity in different frame views.
